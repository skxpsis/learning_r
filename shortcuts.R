# ============ COMMENTS ===============================================
# As stated earlier that R doesn’t support multi-lined comments, 
# but to make the commenting process easier, 
# R allows commenting multiple single lines at once. 
# There are two ways to add multiple single-line comments in R Studio:
#   
# First way: Select the multiple lines which you want to comment using 
# the cursor and then use the key combination “control + shift + C” to 
# comment or uncomment the selected lines.
# 
# Second way: The other way is to use the GUI, select the lines which you
# want to comment by using the cursor and click on “Code” in menu, 
# a pop-up window pops out in which we need to select 
# “Comment/Uncomment Lines” which appropriately comments or uncomment the 
# lines which you have selected.
